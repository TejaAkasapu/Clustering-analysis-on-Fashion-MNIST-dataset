# Clustering-analysis-on-Fashion-MNIST-dataset
To aim of this project is to cluster the images of given Fashion-MNIST dataset and identify any given image as belonging to one of the clusters.
For achieving this, first I have used K-Means clustering algorithm, then built an Auto-encoder to condense dimensionality of the data set and implementedthe K-Means using Sklearn library.
Finally I have used a Auto-encoder based Gaussian mixture model clustering model on the condensed data set. 
The developed models have been validated and tested successfully for accuracy and confusion matrix has been drawn
